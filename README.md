# Bayesian network
Bayesian network implementation and probability calculation algorithms.<br>

  1.	**Bayes ball:** <br>
      An efficient algorithm for checking the interdependence of nodes in a Bayesian network
  3.	**Variable Elimination:** <br>
      Variable elimination (VE) is a simple and general exact inference algorithm in probabilistic graphical models, such as Bayesian networks.<br>
      It can be used for inference of maximum a posteriori (MAP) state or estimation of conditional or marginal distributions over a subset of variables.<br>
      The algorithm has exponential time complexity, but could be efficient in practice for low-treewidth graphs, if the proper elimination order is used.
